# deskpad UI

The screens implemented here are designed to be used by a 15-button Elgato Stream Deck. The asset resolution on this deck is 72x72 pixels, so any images are resized to fit these constraints. If text needs to be rendered to a button, the TextIcon can be used to generate an image suitable for display on the stream deck.

Screens should not maintain their own state.
